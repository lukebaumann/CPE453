No special instructions besides adding the library directory.

Did not check the environment variables or record any errors in stderr

I have ran multiple tests verifying that the memory that is allocated from
malloc is copied correctly and I do not understand why it is not passing
test 20 and 21. I have included my main.c that tests. make main will compile it.
